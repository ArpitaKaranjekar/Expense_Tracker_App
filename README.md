# Flutter Expense Tracker App

The Expense Tracker App is a simple app for managing and tracking your daily expenses. It allows users to add, delete and modify expense categories. It uses BLoC (Business Logic Component) for state management, while keeping all data stored locally on the device using Shared Preferences.
# Features

• Track Total Expense: Automatically calculates and displays the total of all added expenses.

• Personalized Greeting: Dynamically greets the user with "Good Morning," "Good Afternoon," or "Good Evening" based on the current time.

• Add Expense Categories: Create custom categories for organizing expenses (e.g., Food, Travel, Shopping).

• Delete Categories: Remove unwanted categories.

• Modify Categories: Update existing categories easily.

• Local Data Storage: Data is securely stored locally using Shared Preferences, ensuring privacy and fast access.

• State Management: Utilizes BLoC architecture to separate business logic from UI, making the app scalable and maintainable.
